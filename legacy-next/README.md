# Legacy Next.js Demo (Frozen)

This directory contains the previous serverful demonstration built with Next.js and Vercel. It is preserved for reference only and is no longer maintained.

- Status: read‑only (do not modify)
- Purpose: historical demo and migration reference
- Replacement: the new decentralized dApp under `../onchain-dapp/` (IPFS + on‑chain)

Notes
- Server code, API routes, and Vercel-specific configuration are deprecated.
- Do not add new features here. All new work happens in `onchain-dapp/`, `contracts/`, `sdk/`, and optional `workers/`.
